A good way to start with RnR site without having a client is to use lead generation networks who will handle the calls 
- similar to Homeadvisor. But do NOT use HA ever. This way, you get your calls answered and clients referred to local businesses. 
This way you monetize your site immediately while you get a feel of how many leads you get per month, what is the payouts, 
what type of jobs do people want and find you as (a great way to optimize your seo/content), etc. 
In addition to that, if you record the calls and see which businesses are taking the leads from your lead network, 
after a while you can contact those businesses directly. You already know they buy leads, they are more than familiar with 
the concept and this way you can then go directly to the client without middle-man. And if your client quites or is being 
a jerk with payments - you can always revert back to the lead network.

If you’re receiving calls then you should have someone you’re selling the leads to. 
In the case that you haven’t sorted that out or your in between partners, 
put up a messaging service that collects their name and number and says you’ll get back to them when your service isn’t overbooked.

For example, you become the number 1 website for “gardeners in Los Angeles”. 
Then find a real gardener and let him put his phone number and contact information on it. 
If he no longer wants to you remove his info and put another one on it.
